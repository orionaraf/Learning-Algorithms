# **Learning Algorithms**

Welcome to the **Learning Algorithms** repository! This project is a collection of algorithms implemented in C++, designed to enhance my understanding of algorithmic concepts and their applications. Each algorithm is tested using custom functions to ensure correctness and efficiency.

## **Project Structure**

The repository is organized into the following files and directories:

```
├── main.cpp         // Entry point of the program
├── algorithms.cpp   // Contains implemented algorithms
├── algorithms.h     // Header file for algorithms
├── functions.cpp    // Contains functions to test algorithms
├── functions.h      // Header file for functions
├── Makefile         // Makefile for bundling the project
```

### **File Descriptions**

- **`main.cpp`**: The entry point for running and testing the implemented algorithms.
- **`algorithms.cpp` & `algorithms.h`**: Contain the implementation of various algorithms along with their corresponding function declarations.
- **`functions.cpp` & `functions.h`**: Provide utility functions and test cases to verify the correctness of the algorithms.

## **How to Use**

To run the program and test the algorithms:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/orionaraf/Learning-Algorithms/
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd "Learning Algorithms"
   ```
3. Use Makefile to compile the project
   ```bash
   make
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./project
   ```

## **Future Plans**

- Add more algorithms (e.g., dynamic programming, greedy algorithms).
- Include performance benchmarks for implemented algorithms.
- Add detailed comments and documentation for each algorithm.
